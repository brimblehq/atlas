2. Install dependencies with `yarn install`
3. You can look at the `packages` directory and find the `api` and `client` directory.
4. Create a new file `.env` inside of the `client` directory. If it doesn't exist, then copy the contents of `.env.example` into it to be able to run the client on a development environment.
5. Do the same for `api` create a `.env` inside of the `api` directory. If it doesn't exist, then copy the contents of `.env.example` into it to be able to run the server on a development environment.

### Running the server locally

2. This will run the api and the client on http://localhost:9999 and http://localhost:8080 respectively.
