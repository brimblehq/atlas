## Development process

1. [Fork](https://help.github.com/articles/fork-a-repo/) this repository to your own GitHub account and then [clone](https://help.github.com/articles/cloning-a-repository/) it to your local device
2. Install dependencies with `yarn install`
3. You can look at the `packages` directory and find the `api` and `client` directory.
4. Create a new file `.env` inside of the `client` directory. If it doesn't exist, then copy the contents of `.env.example` into it to be able to run the client on a development environment.
5. Do the same for `api` create a `.env` inside of the `api` directory. If it doesn't exist, then copy the contents of `.env.example` into it to be able to run the server on a development environment.

### Running the server locally

1. Startup the server - Run `yarn start | yarn dev`

2. This will run the api and the client on http://localhost:9999 and http://localhost:8080 respectively.

### Testing

For now no test has been written. But we're looking towards writting tests.
